Reference for the project
Git Tutorial
PROJECT:- Game Of Cricket:

Create a separate branch for every improvement or changes asked to keep a track.



Write all the necessary classes for a cricket game which you seem is required

Match controller to take 2 teams and uses the sequence of random function calls and prints the results.
Match controller to take 2 teams and uses the sequence of random function calls and prints the results.
Run multiple times and print results

Learning outcome :-  OOP’s Concepts ,  Basics Of Git


Phase 2
Pre-Requisite

You should have Understanding OOP’s Concepts, Git



ScoreBoard should be printed after every match (should contain overs done, Batting team, batsman, run on curr ball, total runs). Feel free to enhance more also
Now make sure each player is defined as BatsMan or Bowler. Modify the random function to returns runs in high probability than wicket for the Batsman.

Learning outcome :-  Project Enhancement , Adaptive to change


Phase 3
Pre-Requisite

You should have Understanding OOP’s Concepts, Git, Better Code Quality



Use jdbc for (mySql/mongo/ES/Dynamo) to store relevant info in db. Major part of the task is you have to decide what all info needs  to be stored.
Minimum requirements : scoreBoard, Match result
- It would be better to store results of players in db also
Give db heirarchy some thought and how you should go about implementing it.
Write methods to retrieve said data from db

Learning outcome :- MYSQL Schema, Jdbc connection, CRUD, Normalization


Phase 4
Pre-Requisite

You should have Understanding OOP’s Concepts, Git, Better Code Quality, Database Connnections, basic CRUD.



Use spring to expose api's for the following
- to start a match or series for a given overs and (matches in case of series)
- to fetch the the details of a player in a given match
- to fetch the details of a given match and series

Learning outcome :-  Spring, Rest API design, MVC pattern
